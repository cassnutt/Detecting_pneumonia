    "This project aims to classify chest radiographs as being \"normal\" or having \"pneumonia\" present. Using machine learning and neural networks, the models attempt to learn and predict when pneumonia exists in an X-ray with an accuracy above 80% and having a false negative rate of <3%. "

    "## Background about Pneumonia\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs and can cause lungs to fill with fluid. This disease can be caused by many organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi. Combining multiple microbes that cause the disease with a way to spread them through coughing and sneezing makes pneumonia very contagious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumonia can be deadly to all, but is especially dangerous to older adults and children under five-years-old. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death worldwide for children under five. \n",
    "\n",
    "Treating pneumonia can be difficult, as well. Antibiotics work well for bacterial pneumonia but antibiotic resistance (germs develop an ability to defeat the drugs assigned to kill them) is becoming one of the biggest public health challenges to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vaccine to prevent pneumonia, but other vaccines that prevent other diseases tend to work better. Vaccines for influenza, measles, and whooping cough (pertussis) can protect a person from the same bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia."

    "The dataset from Kaggle is partitioned into training, test, and validation folders, which are further separated into the target variables -- \"Normal\" or \"Pneumonia\". There are 5856 total images. \n",
    "\n",
    "The radiographs in each target variable are imbalanced with around 75% classified as \"Pneumonia\" and the other 25% as \"Normal\". The test set is slightly more balanced at about a two-thirds / one-third split with normal radiographs being the latter.\n",
